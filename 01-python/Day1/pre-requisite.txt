1. Install python
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install packages
    pip install pytest              (we need this because playwright runs on pytest framework)
    pip install pytest-playwright   (on top of pytest we required to install playwright)
    install playwright              (we also have to install browsers engine drivers to run our test cases on it so we need this to be installed too)
                                    This is basically download all the browsers such as
                                    -   chromium,
                                    -   firefox,
                                    -   webkit  it is also used to record videos
                                    -   FFMPEG (it helps to record videos).
