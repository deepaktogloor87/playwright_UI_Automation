# what is the difference between type casting and type conversion
# type casting is a process of converting one data type to another
# type conversion is a process of converting one data type to another

# type casting is done by using the type casting operator (will see operators topic)
# type conversion is done by using the type conversion function (will see functions topic)

# type casting operator
# 1. int
# 2. float
# 3. str
# 4. bool
# 5. complex
